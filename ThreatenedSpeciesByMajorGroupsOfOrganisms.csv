The figures displayed below reflect increased assessment efforts by IUCN and its Partners over time, rather than genuine changes in numbers of threatened species.

NOTES (for rows and columns as indicated by the superscripted numbers):,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. The sources used for the numbers of described species in each taxonomic group are listed below.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. Threatened species are those listed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) or Vulnerable (VU).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. Where <80% of species within a group have been evaluated, figures for % threatened species are not provided because there is insufficient coverage for these groups. It is only possible to provide reliable figures for % threatened species for those groups that are completely or almost completely evaluated (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians and gymnosperms).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. The percentage of threatened species can be calculated for those groups that are completely or almost completely evaluated (>80% of species evaluated), but the actual number of threatened species is often uncertain because it is not known whether Data Deficient (DD) species are actually threatened or not. Therefore, a range of percentages is provided: lower estimate = % threatened extant species (if all DD species
are not threatened); best estimate = % threatened extant species (if DD species are equally threatened as data sufficient species); upper estimate = % threatened extant species (if all DD species are threatened). If a single figure is required for reporting purposes, the best estimate figure should be used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. The number of described and evaluated mammals excludes domesticated species like sheep (Ovis aries ), goats (Capra hircus ), Dromedary (Camelus dromedarius ), etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. Crustaceans include six classes: Malacostraca (crabs, lobsters, shrimp, woodlice, etc.); Branchiopoda (fairy shrimp, clam shrimp, etc.); Cephalocardia (horseshoe shrimp); Ostracoda (seed shrimp); Maxillopoda (barnacles, copepods, etc.); and Remipedia (remipedes)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7. The plant numbers DO NOT include species from the 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants (Walter and Gillett 1998) as those were all assessed using the pre-1994 IUCN system of threat categorization. Hence the numbers of of threatened plants are very much lower when compared to the 1997 results. The results from this Red List and the 1997 Plants Red List should be combined together when reporting on
threatened plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8. Mosses include the true mosses (Bryophyta), the hornworts (Anthoceratophyta), and liverworts (Marchantiophyta).
9. The ferns and allies include club mosses and spike mosses (Lycopodiopsida), quillworts (Isoetopsida), horsetails (Equisetopsida) and ferns (Marattiopsida, Polypodiopsida and Psilotopsida).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10. Seaweeds are included in the green algae (Chlorophyta, Charophyta), red algae (Rhodophyta), and brown algae (Ochrophyta or Heterokontophyta).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (available at http://vertebrates.si.edu/msw/mswCFApp/msw/index.cfm). But there are some deviations, especially in cases where there are alternative taxonomic treatments; in such cases the Global Mammal Assessment coordinating team working with the relevant
IUCN SSC Specialist Group advise on which treatment to follow. A number of differences and deviations are also based on new revisions and published papers that have appeared since the accounts in Wilson and Reeder (2005) were published. There are a number of recently described species which are currently under review and hence these are not included in the numbers cited here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Invertebrates
Insects â€“ Estimates of the number of insects in the world vary from about 720,000 to more than 1 million, but the most reasonable mid-point figure appears to be about 1 million (see discussion in Chapman, A.D. 2009 . Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World, 2nd edition . Australian Biological Resources Study, Canberra. Available at:

"Crustaceans â€“ The estimated number of described species of Crustacea in the world varies from 25,000 to 68,171 but the best estimate is 47,000 (see discussion in Chapman, A.D. 2009 . Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World, 2nd edition. Australian Biological Resources Study, Canberra.

"Molluscs â€“ The estimated number of described mollusc species ranges from 50,000 to 120,000. The best estimate by Chapman (2009) appears to be about 85,000 species. (For further discussion on the numbers of molluscs, see Chapman, A.D. 2009 . Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World, 2nd edition. Australian Biological Resources Study, Canberra.

"Corals â€“ Corals fall under the Phylum Cnidaria and are primarily in the Class Anthozoa, although there are some in the Class Hydrozoa. The number of described species reported here are for species typically regarded as 'corals' and are largely based on Spalding et al . (2001) (Alcyonarian corals); and Cairns (1999) (Scleractinian corals). The remainder of the cnidarians, anemones, jellyfish, etc., are treated under
'Others'."
"Arachnids (spiders, scorpions, etc) â€“ Estimates of the number of described arachnids vary from 60,000 to 102,248, the latter is from Chapman (2009) and is calculated from a breakdown of the numbers by Order and appears to be the best figure to use (see discussion in Chapman, A.D. 2009 . Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World, 2nd edition. Australian Biological Resources Study, Canberra. Available
at: http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/2009/04-02-groups-invertebrates.html#arachnida. Accessed 17 June 2012)."
"Velvet Worms â€“ The number of described species of Onychophora (velvet worms) would appear to be around 165 (for further details see discussion in Chapman, A.D. 2009 . Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World, 2nd edition. Australian Biological Resources Study, Canberra. Available at: http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/2009/04-02-groups-
invertebrates.html#onychophora. Accessed 17 June 2012)."
"Horseshoe Crabs â€“ Horseshoe crabs are placed on the Red List under the traditional class ""Merostomata"" which excludes the fossil sea scorpions; only four species are extant today (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merostomata for further details)."
"Others â€“ This is a miscellaneous group of invertebrate species that have been assessed for the IUCN Red List. The total number of described species is based on the estimated totals for the following groups from which the assessed species come: Annelida - segmented worms (16,763), Cnidaria - anemones, jellyfish, etc. but excluding the corals which are treated separately (7,620), Echinodermata -starfish (7,003
species), Myriapoda - centipedes and millipedes (16,072), Nemertina - ribbon worms (1,200), and Platyhelminthes - flat worms (20,000). (For further details on the numbers in these groups see: Chapman, A.D. 2009 . Numbers of Living Species in Australia and the World, 2nd edition. Australian Biological Resources Study, Canberra.
